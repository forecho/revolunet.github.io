So today was the opening of the 2013 GoogleIO developer conference in San Francisco and the Googlers announced a **insanely crazy** amount of new projects/services/features in just the first few hours, which is very exciting for every web/android developer. The next three days will be very busy, with a lot of focus on Chrome, Android and Google+.

Though, we don't have new Nexus devices, no Android 4.3, and no Javascript AppEngine runtime. So huge fail on my [previous predictions](https://twitter.com/revolunet/status/333620420798472192).

The keynote started with a big fail demo effect happened in the very first demo about Android multiplayer gaming when demoing a new Google Cloud Messaging feature, quite embarassing, but then everything ran smoothly.

Here's a little recap of the most important things announced just during the 3 hours keynote :

## [Android](http://officialandroid.blogspot.fr/2013/05/androidio-just-press-play.html)

 - Google cloud messaging : can now be used in a bidirectionnal way, and apps can now also store data in the cloud and sync it across devices (scores, leaderboards...).
 - Google Game Services platform to help game developers with new APIs
 - Samsung Galaxy S4 will be available in June on Google Play with standard Android build and unlocked bootloader ! 649$ though but without that ugly, messy, shitty Samsung overlay.
